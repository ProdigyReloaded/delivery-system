defmodule Prodigy.Server.Router do

  The Router implements the service invocation function and stores context data.

  An instance of the Router is created for each active connection.

  The Router is responsible for:
  * Storing an instance of `Prodigy.Server.Context`
  * receiving packets from `Prodigy.Server.Protocol.Dia`
  * invoking the appropriate Service (that implements `Prodigy.Server.Service`) and passing to it the packet itself and
    the context
  * Storing the updated Context as received from the Service
  * Returning any response received from the service to the reception system (note, DIA vs TOCS)

  Dispatch packets to the relevant service module.

  The service module is selected by the following:
  * DIA destination ID
  * When necessary, the first byte of the DIA packet payload

  The entire deserialized DIA Fm0 packet (`Prodigy.Server.Protocol.Dia.Packet.Fm0`) and the `Prodigy.Server.Context` is
  passed to the service.  The service returns:
  * A status atom (:ok, :error, or :disconnect)
  * The `Prodigy.Server.Context` struct, updated as appropriate
  * Optionally, A binary response payload

  The router will update the stored `Prodigy.Server.Context` with the value returned, and the binary response payload
  will be returned to `Prodigy.Server.Protocol.Dia`, then to `Prodigy.Server.Protocol.Tcs` where it will ultimately be
  chunked, encapsulated, and sent to the Reception System.
